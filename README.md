Optical Imaging and Spectroscopy Pipeline
=========================================

This is a comprehensive data reduction pipeline for optical instruments.
Aim of this pipeline is to provide users a single pipeline interface for reducing multiple instrument data.

Currently, this pipeline supports following instruments
+ HFOSC @HCT, India : (Both Imaging and Spectroscopy data)
+ IFOSC @IGO, India : (Both Imaging and Spectroscopy data)

The pipeline's user interface is very similar to [TIRSPEC](http://indiajoe.github.io/TIRSPEC/) (NIR instrument @HCT)

Hence, for detailed instruction on how to install and run the pipeline, see its wiki page : https://github.com/indiajoe/TIRSPEC/wiki

Feedbacks in form of suggestions and pull requests are more than welcome.
